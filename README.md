# MTA Subway Origin-Destination Ridership Analysis: 2023

## Data Description

This project analyzes the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) subway ridership data for 2023. The dataset provides estimates of subway travel patterns based on scaled-up OMNY and MetroCard return tap and swipe data for 2023. 

Key features include:

- Estimated passenger volumes for all populated origin-destination (OD) pairs
- Aggregation by month, day of the week, and hour of day
     - Data is averaged across the monthâ€”highest time granularity is an average Monday in September at 2pm for example
- Name, ID, and approximate latitude and longitude of origin and destination subway complexes
